## 1. What are cookies?
Cookies are small text files placed on your device when you visit websites. They help the Site remember preferences, enable core functionality, and provide analytics.

## 2. Types of cookies we use
- **Essential cookies:** Required for the Site to function (e.g., session management, authentication). These cannot be disabled if you want to use core features.
- **Preference cookies:** Remember choices you make (language, display preferences).
- **Analytics cookies:** Help us understand how visitors interact with the Site so we can improve features and performance (e.g., page views, navigation patterns).
- **Advertising cookies (if applicable):** May be used by third parties to deliver targeted adverts. We do not serve targeted advertising directly from the Site.

## 3. First-party vs Third-party cookies
Some cookies are set directly by CentriaCyber (first-party). We may also allow third parties (analytics providers, embedded widgets) to set cookies; their use is governed by those third parties’ policies.

## 4. Managing cookies & consent
- **Browser controls:** Most browsers let you refuse or delete cookies via settings. Note that blocking essential cookies may break Site functionality.
- **Cookie banner / consent controls:** Where required by law, the Site will ask for consent to use non-essential cookies. You can change your consent preferences via the Site’s cookie settings (if available) or your browser.
- **Opting out of analytics:** If we use third-party analytics, opt-out links or instructions will be provided when required.

## 5. Retention
Cookie durations vary: session cookies expire when you close your browser; persistent cookies remain for a fixed period (days, months, or years) depending on their purpose.

## 6. Changes to cookie usage
We may update our cookie use to reflect new features or legal requirements. Notices of material changes will appear on the Site.
