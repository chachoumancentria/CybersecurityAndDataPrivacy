**Effective date:** December 18, 2025

## 1. Introduction
CentriaCyber (“we”, “us”, “our”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what personal data we collect when you use our booking system, how we use it, who we share it with, and your rights.

## 2. Data We Collect
We collect the following categories of data as necessary to deliver the Service:
- **Account & identity data:** name, email address, username, role (e.g., reserver).
- **Reservation data:** resource identifiers, reservation start/end times, notes you provide.
- **Technical & usage data:** IP address, device and browser information, cookies and similar technologies, pages visited and actions taken.
- **Communications:** messages you send to support or system notifications (e.g., confirmations).

## 3. How We Use Your Data
We use data to:
- Provide, operate, and maintain the booking Service;
- Process and manage reservations and related communications;
- Authenticate users, secure accounts, and prevent fraud or abuse;
- Improve and personalize the Service, and analyze usage;
- Comply with legal obligations.

## 4. Legal Bases for Processing (where applicable)
- Performance of a contract (to provide the Service and manage reservations);
- Legitimate interests (security, fraud prevention, Service improvement);
- Consent (e.g., optional marketing communication, if offered);
- Legal obligation (to meet regulatory or legal requests).

## 5. Sharing & Disclosure
We may share personal data with:
- **Service providers:** payment processors, hosting providers, analytics providers, and other vendors who perform services on our behalf;
- **Legal & safety:** when required by law or to protect rights, safety, or property;
- **Business transfers:** in connection with a sale, merger, or acquisition (we will notify users where required).

We do not sell personal data for advertising purposes.

## 6. Third-Party Services
The Service may include links or integrations with third-party services (e.g., calendar providers). Those services have their own privacy practices; we encourage you to review their policies.

## 7. Data Retention
We retain personal data only as long as necessary for the purposes described or as required by law. Reservation records are typically retained for a reasonable operational period; specific retention schedules depend on legal, fiscal, or operational requirements.

## 8. Security
We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect data. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure; we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 9. Your Rights
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights including:
- Access and obtain a copy of your data;
- Rectify inaccurate data;
- Request deletion of your data (subject to legal retention obligations);
- Restrict or object to certain processing;
- Request portability of your data;
- Withdraw consent where processing is based on consent.

To exercise rights, contact support@centriacyber.example. We may require verification before fulfilling requests.

## 10. International Transfers
Data may be processed or stored in jurisdictions different from your own. We take steps to ensure appropriate protections (standard contractual clauses, vendor assessments) when transferring data internationally.

## 11. Children
The Service is not intended for children under applicable minimum ages. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children without parental consent. If you believe we have collected data from a child, contact us.

## 12. Changes to this Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy. Material changes will be posted with a new effective date. Continued use after changes indicates acceptance.
